# About _SPUG_

Welcome to home of the Spokane Python User Group (_SPUG_), Spokane's premiere local Python user group! We have a wide range of topics all related to Python, Web Development, and Open Source technology. We're currently meeting on the **third Tuesday of each month**.

All meetings are free, and we encourage everyone to participate and get involved and help grow the Python community. We try to base our meetings from attendee suggestions. If you have an idea for a topic that you would like to see (or present), please let the organizers know!

Our meetups events are managed on [:fontawesome-brands-meetup: Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Spokane/){target=_blank}.

Our mascot is "Stan the Snake":
