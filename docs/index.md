Why can you reassign a variable from a string to an integer in Python but not some other languages? Is Python a typed language? Is Python strongly or weakly typed? Does it using static or dynamic typing? What's the Typing module all about? Are there other options than MyPy for type checking (heck, what _is_ MyPy)? What is duck typing???

These are all questions I've asked myself at some point or another. In this month's Python User Group Meetup, we're going to dive into all things typing related.

The goal is you come out the other end of this meetup having answers to all these questions and more, and to be able to answer the question "Do I want to use typing tools in my Python projects?"

Do you want to learn about using a web framework in Python?
Are you tired of using Flask and looking for something more?
Have you used Django but want to try something new?

Then join us Tuesday, May 18th to learn about how to get started with one of the fastest-growing Python web frameworks, FastAPI! According to the 2020 Python Developers Survey, FastAPI is the third most popular web framework.

https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python-type hints.
