# Spokane Python User Group

## About

Welcome to home of the Spokane Python User Group (_SPUG_), Spokane's premiere local Python user group! We have a wide range of topics all related to Python, Web Development, and Open Source technology. We're currently meeting on the first Tuesday of each month.

All meetings are free, and we encourage everyone to participate and get involved and help grow the Python community. We try to base our meetings from attendee suggestions. If you have an idea for a topic that you would like to see (or present), please let the organizers know!

Our meetups events are managed on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Spokane/).

> Why can you reassign a variable from a string to an integer in Python but not some other languages? Is Python a typed language? Is Python strongly or weakly typed? Does it using static or dynamic typing? What's the Typing module all about? Are there other options than MyPy for type checking (heck, what _is_ MyPy)? What is duck typing???
> 
> These are all questions I've asked myself at some point or another. In this month's Python User Group Meetup, we're going to dive into all things typing related.
> 
> The goal is you come out the other end of this meetup having answers to all these questions and more, and to be able to answer the question "Do I want to use typing tools in my Python projects?"
