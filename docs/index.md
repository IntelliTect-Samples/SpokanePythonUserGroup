# Spokane Python User Group

Welcome to home of the Spokane Python User Group, Spokane's premiere local Python group! We have a wide range of topics all related to Python, Web Development, and Open Source technology. We try to meet on the 3rd Tuesday each month.

All meetings are free, and we encourage everyone to participate and get involved and help grow the Python community. We're currently meeting online-only due to COVID-19. We try to base our meetings from attendee suggestions. If you have an idea for a topic that you would like to see (or present), please let the organizers know!

Our meetups are managed through [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Spokane/).

### Typing for Fun and Profit

_June 15, 2021_

[Code Samples](https://github.com/IntelliTect-Samples/SpokanePythonUserGroup/tree/main/2021.06.15-Typing)

Why can you reassign a variable from a string to an integer in Python but not some other languages? Is Python a typed language? Is Python strongly or weakly typed? Does it using static or dynamic typing? What's the Typing module all about? Are there other options than MyPy for type checking (heck, what _is_ MyPy)? What is duck typing???

These are all questions I've asked myself at some point or another. In this month's Python User Group Meetup, we're going to dive into all things typing related.

The goal is you come out the other end of this meetup having answers to all these questions and more, and to be able to answer the question "Do I want to use typing tools in my Python projects?"

### Getting Started with FastAPI

_May 18, 2021_

[Code Samples](https://github.com/IntelliTect-Samples/SpokanePythonUserGroup/tree/main/2021.05.18-FastAPI)

Do you want to learn about using a web framework in Python?
Are you tired of using Flask and looking for something more?
Have you used Django but want to try something new?

Then join us Tuesday, May 18th to learn about how to get started with one of the fastest-growing Python web frameworks, FastAPI! According to the 2020 Python Developers Survey, FastAPI is the third most popular web framework.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python-type hints.
