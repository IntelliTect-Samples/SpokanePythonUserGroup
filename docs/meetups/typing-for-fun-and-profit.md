# Typing for Fun and Profit

_June 15, 2021_ | [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Spokane/events/278681498/) | [Code Samples](https://github.com/python-spokane/typing-for-fun-and-profit)

Why can you reassign a variable from a string to an integer in Python but not some other languages? Is Python a typed language? Is Python strongly or weakly typed? Does it using static or dynamic typing? What's the Typing module all about? Are there other options than MyPy for type checking (heck, what _is_ MyPy)? What is duck typing???

These are all questions I've asked myself at some point or another. In this month's Python User Group Meetup, we're going to dive into all things typing related.

The goal is you come out the other end of this meetup having answers to all these questions and more, and to be able to answer the question "Do I want to use typing tools in my Python projects?"
