Welcome to Pragmatic Python, a new series of meetups that will focus on building your Python knowledge from the ground up. For the next several meetups, we'll focus on taking you from a small garter snake all the way to a full-fledged, certified* Python-ista! üêç

This month's meetup, "Welcome to the Jungle", will focus on getting started with Python. Topics will include installing python, writing basic scripts, a look at popular libraries, and more!
