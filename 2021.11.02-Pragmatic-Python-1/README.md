#### Answer: 3

Python 2 has been [sunset](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).

In 2021, this is a non-issue.

# Installing Python
#### Windows
[https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) _or_
```powershell
>choco install python
```

#### Linux
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python
```

---
# Installing Python (cont'd)
#### Mac OS X

[https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/python-3-default-mac)

tl;dr: use `pyenv` or Homebrew. **Don't use the built-in Python.**

# Editing Python
#### IDLE
_**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment and **L**earning **E**nvironment_
Python-specific

#### IDE
_**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment_
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

# What is a **Module**?

> A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. 

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html


---
# Anatomy of a **Module**

`script.py`
```python
import sys                  # <-- importing a package

def main():                 # <-- function declaration
    car = sys.argv[1]
    print(f"Your favorite car is a {car}!")  # <-- an "f-string"

if __name__ == "__main__":  # <-- only execute if run as the entry point
    main()                  # <-- calling a function
```

```bash
$ python script.py "Mitsubishi Montero Sport"    # <-- running a python module
Your favorite car is a Mitsubishi Montero Sport!
```

---
# What is a **Package**?

> Packages are a way of structuring Python‚Äôs module namespace by using ‚Äúdotted module names‚Äù.

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages

# Anatomy of a **Package**
```text
app/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __main__.py
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
```
`__init__.py`
```python
# marks directory as a python package
```

`__main__.py`
```python
# executed when the package itself is invoked using -m 
from .app import run

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```

---
# Anatomy of a **Package** (cont'd)
`app.py`
```python
import sys

def main():
    car = sys.argv[1]
    print(f"Your least favorite car is a {car}!")
```

```bash
$ python -m app "Chrysler PT Cruiser"
Your least favorite car is a Chrysler PT Cruiser!
```
